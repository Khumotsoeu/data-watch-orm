## About the project

DataWatchORM is a lightweight, flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library designed to simplify database interactions in Python. Inspired by Django's ORM, DataWatchORM provides intuitive APIs for defining schemas, querying data, and managing relationships between models, all while offering the flexibility to extend and modify query behavior. DataWatchORM makes it easy to build and maintain database-driven applications with clean, readable code.
